If I had been a heathen, I'd have praised the purple vine
My slaves should dig the vineyard, and I would drink the wine
But Higgins is a heathen, and his slaves grow lean and gray
That he should drink some tepid milk exaclty twice a day

If I had been a heathen, I'd have praised Neara's curls
And filled my life with love affairs, my house with dancing girls
But Higgins is a heathen, and to lecture rooms is forced
Where his aunts, who are not married, demand to be divorced
