APRIL is the cruellest month, breeding
Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
Memory and desire, stirring
Dull roots with spring rain.	 
Winter kept us warm, covering
Earth in forgetful snow, feeding 
A little life with dried tubers.
Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee...

The river's tent is broken: the last fingers of leaf
Clutch and sink into the wet bank. The wind
Crosses the brown land, unheard. The nymphs are departed.
Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.
